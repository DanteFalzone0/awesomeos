I am archiving much of my old code from when I was first learning to program.
The code in this repository isn't the worst ever, but it was written by copy-
pasting snippets from the internet without any understanding of how they work.

# awesomeos
Some low-level systems programming by Dante Falzone

Dante's eventual goal is to maybe get a very simple OS up and running,
which will be called AwesomeOS. For now, we've got a bootable file,
"awesomeos.bin", which prints a short message to the screen (or at
least in QEmu it does).
